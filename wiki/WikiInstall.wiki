#Installation instructions for Cloud Course

= Introduction =

To run/install Cloud Course, the only pre-requisite is the [http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html Google App Engine SDK] for python.

= Details =

First get the code. Either [http://code.google.com/p/cloudcourse/downloads/list download the binary] or [http://code.google.com/p/cloudcourse/source/checkout check out the source code from subversion].

Make sure configure.sh and make.sh have execute permissions (`chmod +x *.sh`)

1 - Run configure.sh. This will download and set up the dependencies.

2 - Update app.yaml:

*appid* should be replaced with your App Engine app id.

3 - Update settings.py:

*ADMIN_EMAIL*  is the email used as sender for every email notification coming from the system. Make sure that whatever email you set is also added on the admin console as a developer of the application.

*CALENDAR_BATCH_EVENT_FEED* is the calendar email used to store Cloud Course events. Every event generated by Cloud Course is created on this calendar.

4 - Run make.sh. This will compile the javascript files and create a unique css (both will have a name including the version from app.yaml).
This step should be repeated every time before you upload the application if and only if you make changes to css and/or javascript files.

5 - Update core/data/timezones.json  and core/data/rooms.json files to configure the system with correct room/timezone information.
The rooms.json and timezones.json files come with examples.


Cloud Course is now ready to be used! You can either run the instance locally or
upload the application.

Check the Cloud Course [WikiCustomization custumization page] for more details on how to customize your instance.
