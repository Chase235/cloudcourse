Installation instructions for CloudCourse

= Introduction =

To run/install CloudCourse, the only pre-requisite is the [http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html Google App Engine SDK] for python.

= Installation =

  # Get the code. Either [http://code.google.com/p/cloudcourse/downloads/list download the binary] or [http://code.google.com/p/cloudcourse/source/checkout check out the source from subversion].

  # Update app.yaml: `<appid>` should be replaced with your App Engine app id.

  # Update settings.py: Configure `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `CALENDAR_BATCH_EVENT_FEED` [WikiCustomization details and more configurations].

  # Update core/data/timezones.json  and core/data/rooms.json files to configure the system with correct room and timezone information respectively. The files come with example data.

  # Run make.sh. Make sure it has execute permissions (chmod +x make.sh). This will compile the javascript and css files. (compiled files will be suffixed by the version from app.yaml). This should be done on subsequent application uploads if there are any changes to the javascript/css/app.yaml files.


CloudCourse is now ready to be deployed on App Engine.

After deployment, some datastore entities needs to be initialized.
Log on CloudCourse with an admin / App Engine developer account.

5 - First step is to populate the database with room information.
Click on the upper right corner `Admin interface` then on `Access points`.
Click `Load rooms` and `Construct AP Info`. You should then see a list of available rooms.

6 - Second step is to authorize the system to access Google Calendar with the specified account above. 
Go back to the `Admin interface` and click on `Configuration`. Then click `Get calendar token` and accept all prompts. You should see a calendar token in the configuration list.


That's it! To make sure that everything works correctly, create some activity and enroll. You should receive email notifications and your calendar should be updated accordingly.
