This page shows how to get started with `CloudCourse` development.

= Introduction =

`CloudCourse` is built with Python and App Engine.
It uses some third party dependencies:
  * GData
  * Closure
  * App Engine patch
  * pytz
  * atom

The [Downloads binaries] include all necessary dependencies.
If you build CloudCourse yourself, you will need to download them manually. The easiest way to set up the dependencies is to look at a CloudCourse binary and replicate the same folder structure for dependencies.

= Getting the code =

[http://code.google.com/p/cloudcourse/source/checkout Check out the code] from subversion.
