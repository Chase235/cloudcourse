This page shows how to get started with `CloudCourse` development.

= Introduction =

`CloudCourse` is built with Python and App Engine.
It uses some third party dependencies:
  * [http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/downloads/list GData]
  * [http://code.google.com/closure/library/docs/gettingstarted.html Closure library] and the [http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/ Closure compiler]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/app-engine-patch/downloads/list App Engine patch]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/gae-pytz/ pytz]
  * atom

The [http://code.google.com/p/cloudcourse/downloads/list binaries] include all necessary dependencies.
If you build CloudCourse yourself, you will need to download them manually. The easiest way to set up the dependencies is to look at a CloudCourse binary and replicate the same folder structure for dependencies.

= Getting the code =
